# Refactoring to Modular Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architectural decisions and implementation details for refactoring the project to a more modular and maintainable structure.

## Problem Statement
The original codebase had several issues:
1. Raw SQL queries scattered throughout the codebase
2. Duplicate database client instances
3. Business logic mixed with API route handlers
4. Lack of type safety
5. Difficult to test and maintain

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Database Client Management
Created a singleton Prisma client in `src/lib/prisma.ts`:
```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as {
  prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;
};

export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? new PrismaClient();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;
}
```
This ensures:
- Single database connection instance
- Proper connection management in development
- Type-safe database operations

### 2. Service Layer Implementation

#### Employee Service (`src/services/employee.service.ts`)
```typescript
export class EmployeeService {
  static async generateEmployeeId(): Promise<string>
  static async getAllEmployees()
  static async getActiveEmployeeCount()
  static async createEmployee(data: EmployeeCreateData)
}
```
Features:
- Type-safe employee operations
- Centralized employee business logic
- Error handling for duplicate IDs
- Consistent employee ID generation

#### Salary Service (`src/services/salary.service.ts`)
```typescript
export class SalaryService {
  static async getSalaryRecords(year: number, month: number): Promise<SalaryRecord[]>
  static async updateSalaryRecord(data: SalaryUpdateData)
}
```
Features:
- Type-safe salary operations
- Complex salary record aggregation
- Efficient database queries with proper relations
- Consistent salary record updates

### 3. API Route Simplification

#### Employee Routes (`src/app/api/employees/route.ts`)
- Simplified to use EmployeeService
- Clean error handling
- Type-safe request/response handling

#### Salary Routes (`src/app/api/salaries/route.ts`)
- Simplified to use SalaryService
- Clean separation of concerns
- Consistent error handling

### 4. Dashboard Integration (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Uses EmployeeService for data fetching
- Clean component structure
- Type-safe data handling

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Business logic in services
   - API routes handle HTTP concerns
   - Database operations centralized

2. **Type Safety**
   - Proper TypeScript types throughout
   - Prisma's type-safe queries
   - Consistent error handling

3. **Maintainability**
   - Smaller, focused files
   - Clear responsibility boundaries
   - Easy to test services in isolation

4. **Performance**
   - Optimized database queries
   - Single database connection
   - Efficient data aggregation

5. **Scalability**
   - Easy to add new features
   - Simple to extend services
   - Clear patterns to follow

## Project Structure
```
src/
├── lib/
│   └── prisma.ts           # Database client
├── services/
│   ├── employee.service.ts # Employee business logic
│   └── salary.service.ts   # Salary business logic
├── app/
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── employees/
│   │   │   └── route.ts   # Employee API endpoints

│   └── dashboard/
│       └── page.tsx       # Dashboard page
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Error Handling**
   - Create custom error classes
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Add error logging service

2. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for services
   - Add integration tests for API routes
   - Add E2E tests for critical flows

3. **Documentation**
   - Add API documentation
   - Add service documentation
   - Add setup instructions

4. **Monitoring**
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Add error tracking
   - Add usage analytics

## Conclusion
The refactoring has significantly improved the codebase's maintainability, type safety, and scalability. The new architecture provides a solid foundation for future development and makes it easier to add new features while maintaining code quality.
